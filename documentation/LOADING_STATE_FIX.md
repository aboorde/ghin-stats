# Loading State Fix Documentation

## Problem
Users were experiencing persistent loading states on the deployed GitHub Pages site where:
- The app would get stuck in a constant loading state
- Clearing cache and hard reload didn't fix it
- Opening new tabs didn't work
- The corrupted state persisted across sessions

## Root Causes Identified
1. **AuthContext not properly handling errors** - Loading state wasn't set to false on profile fetch errors
2. **No error boundaries** - Unhandled errors could leave the app in an undefined state
3. **Session monitor infinite retry loops** - Failed session refreshes would retry forever
4. **Corrupted localStorage/sessionStorage** - Invalid auth data persisted across reloads

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed AuthContext Loading State Management
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- Wrapped initialization in try-catch-finally block
- Always set loading to false, even on errors
- Added automatic cleanup of corrupted auth state
- Made initialization async/await for better error handling

### 2. Added Error Boundary Component
**File**: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`
- Catches all unhandled errors in the component tree
- Provides recovery options:
  - "Try Again" - Soft reset
  - "Clear All Data & Reload" - Hard reset
- Shows error details in development mode
- Tracks retry count to detect persistent errors

### 3. Created Loading Recovery Component
**File**: `src/components/LoadingRecovery.jsx`
- Detects when loading takes longer than 10 seconds
- Offers recovery options:
  - Clear session and reload
  - Reset everything (nuclear option)
- Allows user to keep waiting if desired
- Provides clear explanation of potential causes

### 4. Fixed Session Monitor Infinite Retry
**File**: `src/hooks/useSessionMonitor.js`
- Added MAX_REFRESH_ATTEMPTS limit (3 attempts)
- Implemented exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s max)
- Reset counters after 1 hour of no attempts
- Reset counters on successful refresh

### 5. Added Emergency Reset Mechanisms

#### A. Hidden Emergency Reset Button
**File**: `src/components/Layout.jsx`
- Activated by clicking the logo 5 times rapidly
- Shows for 10 seconds when activated
- Clears all storage and reloads

#### B. URL Parameter Reset
**File**: `src/App.jsx`
- Add `?reset=emergency` to any URL
- Automatically clears all storage and reloads
- Removes parameter after reset to prevent loops

## How to Use Recovery Options

### For Users Stuck in Loading State:

1. **Wait for Auto-Recovery** (10 seconds)
   - LoadingRecovery component will appear automatically
   - Choose "Clear Session & Reload" or "Reset Everything"

2. **Use Emergency Reset Button**
   - Click the "S" logo 5 times quickly
   - Emergency Reset button appears
   - Click to clear all data

3. **Use URL Parameter** (Last Resort)
   - Navigate to: `https://yourdomain.com/ghin-stats/?reset=emergency`
   - App will clear all data and reload automatically

### For Developers:

1. **Error Details**
   - Error boundary shows full stack trace in development
   - Check console for detailed error logs

2. **Session Monitoring**
   - Check console for session refresh attempts
   - Look for "Max refresh attempts reached" message

## Prevention Measures

1. **Graceful Error Handling**
   - All async operations wrapped in try-catch
   - Loading states always cleared on completion

2. **Data Validation**
   - Auth state validated before use
   - Corrupted data automatically cleaned

3. **Retry Limits**
   - All retry operations have maximum attempts
   - Exponential backoff prevents rapid retries

## Testing

To test the recovery mechanisms:

1. **Simulate Stuck Loading**:
   ```javascript
   // In AuthContext, temporarily add:
   await new Promise(() => {}) // Never resolves
   ```

2. **Simulate Corrupted Storage**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('ghin-stats-auth', 'corrupted-data')
   ```

3. **Test Emergency Reset**:
   - Click logo 5 times rapidly
   - Or navigate to `/?reset=emergency`

## Future Improvements

1. Add telemetry to track how often recovery is needed
2. Implement offline detection and handling
3. Add user-friendly error messages for specific error types
4. Consider implementing a service worker for better caching control
