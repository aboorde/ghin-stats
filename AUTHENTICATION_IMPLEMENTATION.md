# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented authentication flow with Supabase Auth, allowing users to sign in and view their golf stats. The app now has a public splash/login page and user-specific profile pages.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
- **AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)
  - Manages authentication state
  - Provides sign in/out functionality
  - Fetches and caches user profile data
  - Auto-refreshes session on auth state changes

### 2. Routing Structure
- **Public Routes**
  - `/` - Login page (redirects to profile if authenticated)
  - `/profile/:userId` - Public profile view (respects privacy settings)
  
- **Protected Routes**
  - `/settings` - User profile management (requires authentication)

### 3. Components Created/Updated

#### New Components:
- **Login.jsx** - Splash page with Supabase Auth UI
  - Dark theme matching app design
  - Sign in/up functionality
  - Link to browse public profiles

- **Profile.jsx** - User profile page
  - Displays user info (name, GHIN, home course, handicap)
  - Navigation between golf stat views
  - Edit profile button for own profile
  - Respects privacy settings

- **Settings.jsx** - Profile management
  - Update personal information
  - Privacy controls (public/private profile)
  - Display preferences
  - Sign out functionality

#### Updated Components:
- **App.jsx** - Added routing and auth provider
- **Layout.jsx** - Simplified, removed old navigation
- **All View Components** - Accept userId prop for filtering data

### 4. Privacy & Security
- Profile visibility settings (public/private)
- Option to hide handicap or scores
- RLS policies enforce data access
- Only authenticated users can edit their own profile

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **New User**: Lands on login page → Signs up → Redirected to their profile
2. **Existing User**: Lands on login page → Signs in → Redirected to their profile
3. **Public Visitor**: Can browse public profiles without signing in

### Data Access:
- Authenticated users see only their own data (enforced by RLS)
- Public profiles visible to anyone if user opts in
- Private profiles show error message to non-owners

### Profile URLs:
- Each user has a unique profile URL: `/profile/{userId}`
- Can be shared if profile is public
- Pine Valley analysis only shows for Pine Valley home course users

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Your Profile:
```
1. Sign in at the root URL
2. Automatically redirected to /profile/your-user-id
3. View all your golf stats
```

### Sharing Your Profile:
```
1. Go to Settings
2. Set Profile Visibility to "Public"
3. Share your profile URL: https://yoursite.com/profile/your-user-id
```

### Managing Privacy:
```
1. Go to Settings
2. Choose what to display:
   - Profile visibility (public/private)
   - Show handicap index
   - Show individual scores
```

## Technical Notes

### Authentication State:
- Managed via React Context API
- Persisted by Supabase Auth
- Auto-refreshes on page reload

### Data Filtering:
- All queries now filter by `user_id` not `golfer_id`
- RLS policies ensure data isolation
- Components gracefully handle no data

### Responsive Design:
- Mobile-first approach maintained
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Optimized for all screen sizes

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Password reset flow
   - Email verification
   - Social login providers (Google, etc.)

2. **Profile Enhancements**:
   - Profile photo upload
   - Bio/description field
   - Achievement badges

3. **Social Features**:
   - Follow other golfers
   - Compare stats
   - Leaderboards

4. **Data Import**:
   - Import rounds from other apps
   - Bulk data upload
   - API for third-party integrations

## Deployment Notes

After deploying:
1. Ensure environment variables are set (VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
2. Test authentication flow in production
3. Verify RLS policies are working
4. Monitor for any authentication errors

The application is now ready for authenticated users to track and share their golf statistics!
