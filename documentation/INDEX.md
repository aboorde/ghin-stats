## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

New to the project? Start here:

1. **Read the [README.md](../README.md)** in the root directory for project overview and setup
2. **Review [DATABASE_SCHEMA.md](01-architecture/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)** to understand the data structure
3. **Check [COMPONENT_GUIDE.md](01-architecture/COMPONENT_GUIDE.md)** for UI component overview
4. **Follow [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](04-deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** to deploy the application

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The GHIN Stats application follows these architectural principles:

- **Frontend**: React with functional components and hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with utility-first approach
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **State Management**: Local component state (no Redux/Context for simplicity)
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for all charts and graphs
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions CI/CD

## üìä Key Features

- **Round by Round Analysis**: Track performance over time with filterable tables and charts
- **Hole by Hole View**: Detailed scorecard view for each round
- **Course Summary**: Performance metrics by course with hole-specific analysis
- **Year by Year Analysis**: Historical trends and seasonal patterns
- **Public Profiles**: Share golf statistics publicly with privacy controls
- **GHIN Handicap Calculation**: Accurate handicap index calculation following USGA rules

## üîí Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Authentication required for data access
- Privacy controls for public profile visibility
- Secure session management with auto-refresh

## üìù Contributing

When contributing to this project:

1. Follow the patterns in [CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md](03-development/CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. Use the atomic components from [COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md](03-development/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md)
3. Maintain the API patterns documented in [API_PATTERNS.md](01-architecture/API_PATTERNS.md)
4. Update relevant documentation when making changes

## üÜò Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Session Timeout**: Implemented auto-refresh in `useSessionMonitor` hook
- **Build Failures**: Check Tailwind CSS v4 configuration in PostCSS
- **Deployment Issues**: Use `deploy-simple.yml` workflow to bypass environment protection
- **RLS Errors**: Verify user authentication and check RLS policies
