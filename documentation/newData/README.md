# New Database Structure for Golf Data Import

This directory contains the documentation and migration files for the new database structure that supports importing golf round data from external APIs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference
- **FINAL_DATABASE_SUMMARY.md** - Complete summary verifying all 99 JSON fields are mapped
- **EXACT_JSON_FIELD_MAPPING.md** - Field-by-field mapping of JSON to database columns

## Files

1. **DATABASE_REDESIGN.md** - Complete documentation of the new database schema, including:
   - Overview of the data import flow
   - Detailed schema for all three tables
   - Security considerations with RLS
   - Migration strategy

2. **FIELD_VALIDATION.md** - Validation document that maps every field from the JSON to database tables:
   - Ensures all 94 fields from the API are accounted for
   - Shows the mapping between JSON fields and database columns
   - Confirms no data will be lost during import

3. **001_create_rounds_table.sql** - Migration to create the main rounds table:
   - 54 fields to store all round-level data
   - Indexes for performance
   - RLS policies for security

4. **002_create_hole_details_table.sql** - Migration to create hole details table:
   - Stores individual hole scores and statistics
   - Linked to rounds table via foreign key
   - Unique constraint to prevent duplicate holes

5. **003_create_round_statistics_table.sql** - Migration to create statistics table:
   - Stores calculated statistics for each round
   - All percentage and average fields
   - One statistics record per round

6. **004_combined_migration.sql** - All migrations in one file:
   - Can be run as a single transaction
   - Includes all tables, indexes, and policies
   - Ready to execute in Supabase SQL editor

7. **import_example.js** - Example JavaScript code for importing data:
   - Shows how to process the API response
   - Handles upserts to prevent duplicates
   - Includes error handling and reporting

## Quick Start

1. Run the combined migration in Supabase:
   ```sql
   -- Copy contents of 004_combined_migration.sql
   -- Paste and run in Supabase SQL editor
   ```

2. The Settings component now uses the import function:
   ```javascript
   // In handleImportData:
   import { importGolfRounds, formatImportSummary } from '../services/importService'
   
   const scores = data.scores || [];
   const importResults = await importGolfRounds(scores, user.id)
   const summary = formatImportSummary(importResults)
   ```

3. The import will:
   - Check if each round already exists for the user
   - Skip rounds that are already imported
   - Create new rounds with all fields
   - Create hole details for each new round
   - Create statistics for each new round
   - Report successful imports, skipped duplicates, and failures

## Key Features

- **Complete Data Preservation**: All 94 fields from the API are stored
- **User Isolation**: RLS ensures users only see their own data
- **Performance**: Indexes on key fields for fast queries
- **Flexibility**: JSONB field for adjustments array
- **Integrity**: Foreign keys maintain relationships
- **Auditability**: Timestamps track when data was imported/updated
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Import process checks for existing rounds and skips them
- **Incremental Syncing**: Users can safely re-import all rounds without creating duplicates

## Next Steps

After running the migrations, the application can:
1. Import data from external APIs via the Settings page
2. Display imported rounds in existing views
3. Calculate handicaps and statistics from the imported data
4. Maintain full history of all rounds
