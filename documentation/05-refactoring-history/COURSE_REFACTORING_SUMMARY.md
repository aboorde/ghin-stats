# Course By Course Summary Refactoring

## Overview
Successfully refactored the CourseByCourseSummary component to follow our established model-service-helper architecture, improving code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Created Course Model (`src/models/Course.js`)
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates course statistics and business logic
- **Key Features**:
  - Tracks separate statistics for 18-hole and 9-hole rounds
  - Provides calculated properties (averages, performance levels)
  - Includes methods for performance analysis
  - Factory functions for creating instances from raw data
  - `toJSON()` method for clean serialization

### 2. Enhanced Aggregation Service
- **Added Methods**:
  - `aggregateCourseStatistics()` - Creates Course model instances from scores
  - `calculateCourseHoleAverages()` - Aggregates hole-by-hole performance

### 3. Enhanced Statistics Service  
- **Added Method**:
  - `calculateHoleAveragesForChart()` - Optimized for HolePerformanceChart component

### 4. Enhanced Chart Data Helpers
- **Added Functions**:
  - `prepareCourseHolePerformanceData()` - Formats hole data for charts
  - `getHolePerformanceColor()` - Consistent color coding for performance

### 5. Added Score Helpers
- **Added Function**:
  - `calculateAverage()` - Reusable average calculation with null handling

## Component Improvements

### Before
- 150+ lines of data transformation logic in component
- Complex nested data aggregation
- Difficult to test business logic
- Repeated calculations

### After
- Clean separation of concerns
- Component focuses on UI and data fetching
- Business logic in testable models/services
- Reusable calculations across components

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Testability**: Business logic can be unit tested independently
2. **Reusability**: Course statistics logic available for other components
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between data and presentation
4. **Performance**: Optimized data structures and calculations
5. **Type Safety**: Ready for TypeScript migration with clear interfaces

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Fetch data from Supabase
const scores = await fetchScores()

// Use aggregation service to create Course models
const courses = aggregateCourseStatistics(scores)

// Course model provides all calculated values
const course = courses[0]
console.log(course.getAverageScore18()) // 108.5
console.log(course.getParTypePerformance()) // { avgPar3: 4.2, avgPar4: 5.8, avgPar5: 6.5 }
console.log(course.getPerformanceLevel()) // { color: 'text-yellow-400', level: 'good' }
```

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar refactoring to other view components
2. Add unit tests for Course model and services
3. Consider caching aggregated data for performance
4. Add TypeScript types for better type safety
