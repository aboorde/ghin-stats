# Session Notes - January 6, 2025

## Context Summary

This session focused on improving the golf statistics application with several key enhancements:

### 1. Authentication & Session Management
- **Issue**: Users were experiencing login timeouts after periods of inactivity
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive session management system
  - Added `useSessionMonitor` hook to proactively refresh tokens
  - Created `SessionStatus` component showing session health in bottom-right corner
  - Added auto-refresh when tokens are within 5 minutes of expiring
  - Implemented retry mechanism for failed requests due to expired tokens
  - Enhanced Supabase configuration with `autoRefreshToken: true` and `persistSession: true`

### 2. Round by Round View Enhancements
- **Request**: Make graph always show chronological order while allowing independent table sorting/filtering
- **Implementation**:
  - Separated data flow - graph always uses chronological data
  - Added independent table sorting and filtering
  - New filter options: Course filter, Score range filter (Under 100, 100-109, 110-119, 120+)
  - Clickable column headers for sorting (Date, Course, Score, Differential)
  - Shows "Showing X of Y rounds" to indicate filtered results

### 3. Component Library Creation (Atomic Design)
- **Created comprehensive component library** following atomic design principles
- **Structure**:
  ```
  components/
  ├── atoms/          # Basic building blocks
  ├── molecules/      # Combinations of atoms
  ├── organisms/      # Complex UI sections
  ```

#### Key Components Created:

**Atoms:**
- `MetricCard` - Flexible metric display with themes
- `HoleCard` - Individual hole score display
- `TotalCard` - Score totals display
- `SectionHeader` - Consistent section headers
- `SelectableButton` - Button with selected state
- `ScrollableList` - Reusable scrollable container

**Molecules:**
- `CourseSelector` - Mobile/desktop course selection
- `ParTypePerformance` - Par 3/4/5 performance metrics
- `ScoringDistribution` - Scoring percentages
- `RoundSelector` - Round selection dropdown
- `RoundSummaryCard` - Round summary display
- `NineHoleGrid` - Grid of 9 holes
- `ScoreTypeSummary` - Score type distribution
- `MonthlyPerformanceChart` - Enhanced monthly performance visualization
- `EmptyState` - No data state handler

**Organisms:**
- `CourseStatistics` - Complete course stats panel
- `HoleByHoleScorecard` - Full scorecard display

### 4. Component Refactoring
- **CourseByCourseSummary** - Refactored to use new component library
- **DetailedStats** - Updated to use atomic components
- **HoleByHoleView** - Complete refactor with new components

### 5. Hole by Hole View Bug Fix
- **Issue**: UI didn't update correctly when selecting different rounds from dropdown
- **Root Cause**: Timing mismatch between round selection and hole data loading
- **Solution**:
  - Added `loadingHoles` state
  - Clear previous hole details before fetching new ones
  - Show loading indicator during data fetch
  - Added data validation to catch mismatches
  - Fixed ID comparison (string vs number issue)

### 6. Year by Year Analysis - Monthly Performance Enhancement
- **Issues**:
  - Fixed Y-axis scale [100, 120] not suitable for all players
  - Months with no rounds were completely omitted
  - No visual indication of missing data
- **Solution**: Created `MonthlyPerformanceChart` component with:
  - Dynamic Y-axis scaling based on actual data
  - All 12 months displayed (empty months show dashed outline)
  - Year average reference line
  - Color-coded performance (green = better than avg, red = worse)
  - Enhanced tooltips showing rounds played per month
  - Visual legend explaining the chart

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Atomic Design Pattern** - Chose this for better component reusability and maintenance
2. **Component Composition** - Favored composition over inheritance for flexibility
3. **Utility Functions** - Created `scoringUtils.js` for consistent score calculations
4. **State Management** - Kept local state management, avoiding unnecessary complexity
5. **Error Handling** - Added proper validation and error states throughout

## Data Flow Improvements

1. **Session Management**: Supabase Client → Session Monitor → Auto Refresh → Visual Indicator
2. **Component Data**: Service Layer → Container Component → Atomic Components → UI
3. **Chart Data**: Raw Data → Aggregation Service → Chart Helpers → Visualization Components

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/src/hooks/useSessionMonitor.js`
- `/src/components/SessionStatus.jsx`
- `/src/utils/scoringUtils.js`
- `/src/components/atoms/*.jsx` (multiple atom components)
- `/src/components/molecules/*.jsx` (multiple molecule components)
- `/src/components/organisms/*.jsx` (multiple organism components)
- `/src/components/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md`

### Modified Files:
- `/src/lib/supabase.js` - Enhanced configuration
- `/src/components/RoundByRoundView.jsx` - Added filtering/sorting
- `/src/components/CourseByCourseSummary.jsx` - Refactored with atomic components
- `/src/components/DetailedStats.jsx` - Updated to use component library
- `/src/components/HoleByHoleView.jsx` - Complete refactor
- `/src/components/YearByYearAnalysis.jsx` - Enhanced monthly chart

## Next Steps Recommended

1. Continue migrating remaining components to use the atomic design library
2. Add unit tests for the new atomic components
3. Consider implementing global state management if complexity increases
4. Add animation/transitions to enhance user experience
5. Implement offline support for better reliability
