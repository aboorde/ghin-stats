# Import Service Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Type Conversion Error (Code: 22P02)
**Error**: `"invalid input syntax for type numeric: \"false\""`

**Cause**: Boolean values were being passed directly to numeric database fields.

**Fix**: Added type conversion functions:
- `toNumeric()`: Converts values to numbers, handling booleans (false → 0, true → 1)
- `toBoolean()`: Converts values to proper booleans

### 2. Foreign Key Constraint Error (Code: 23503) 
**Error**: `"insert or update on table \"round_statistics\" violates foreign key constraint"`

**Cause**: Statistics were being inserted in parallel with rounds, causing race conditions where statistics might be inserted before their parent rounds.

**Fix**: 
- Insert rounds FIRST, then wait for completion
- Only insert statistics and hole details AFTER rounds are successfully inserted
- Skip related data if no rounds were inserted

### 3. Unique Constraint Error (Code: 23505)
**Error**: `"duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"unique_round_hole\""`

**Cause**: The hole_details table has a unique constraint on (round_id, hole_number), preventing duplicate entries.

**Fix**: 
- Use proper upsert with `onConflict: 'round_id,hole_number'`
- Set `ignoreDuplicates: true` to allow batch to continue when duplicates exist
- Removed unnecessary delete-before-insert approach
- Now correctly handles partial updates (e.g., 9-hole rounds or missing holes)

## Type Conversions Applied

### Numeric Fields
- All score fields (adjusted_gross_score, differential, etc.)
- All rating fields (course_rating, slope_rating, etc.) 
- Percentages and statistics
- Counts (number_of_holes, putts, etc.)
- Boolean false → 0, true → 1

### Boolean Fields
- exceptional
- is_manual
- posted_on_home_course
- edited
- used
- is_recent
- short_course
- challenge_available
- message_club_authorized
- gir_flag

## Performance
- Still maintains batching efficiency (97% reduction in network requests)
- Adds minimal overhead for type conversion
- No longer deletes existing data (faster and safer)
- Properly handles mixed scenarios (new + existing data)

## Usage
Import from the fixed service:
```javascript
import { importGolfRoundsBatched } from '../services/importServiceBatchedFixed'
```
