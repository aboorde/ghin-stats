# Year By Year Analysis Refactoring

## Overview
Successfully refactored the YearByYearAnalysis component to follow the established model-service-helper architecture pattern, removing 100+ lines of inline data transformations and creating a comprehensive year analysis system.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Created Year Model (`src/models/Year.js`)
- **Purpose**: Encapsulates yearly golf statistics and performance metrics
- **Key Features**:
  - Tracks rounds, scores, differentials for each year
  - Monthly performance breakdown
  - Course play frequency tracking
  - Par type performance arrays (Par 3/4/5)
  - Scoring distribution (pars, bogeys, doubles+)
  - Factory method `fromRounds()` for easy instantiation
  - Conversion methods for chart-ready data

### 2. Created Year Analysis Service (`src/services/yearAnalysisService.js`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive year-by-year performance analysis
- **Key Functions**:
  - `aggregateYearlyStatistics()` - Main aggregation using Year model
  - `formatYearDataForCharts()` - Convert to chart-ready format
  - `calculateYearOverYearTrends()` - Track improvement metrics
  - `getSeasonalAnalysis()` - Group performance by seasons
  - `getCompleteYearAnalysis()` - Full analysis for a specific year
  - `calculateYearlyConsistency()` - Standard deviation metrics

### 3. Enhanced Aggregation Service
- Added `aggregateScoresByYearModel()` - Uses Year model for aggregation
- Added `getTimeBasedSummary()` - Overview of temporal data distribution

### 4. Enhanced Chart Data Helpers
- Added year-specific formatting functions:
  - `prepareYearTrendData()` - Multi-line trend charts
  - `prepareMonthlyPerformanceData()` - Monthly bar charts
  - `prepareSeasonalData()` - Seasonal performance
  - `prepareYearScoringDistribution()` - Pie chart data
  - `prepareCourseBreakdownData()` - Course frequency
  - `prepareParTypeComparison()` - Par 3/4/5 display
  - `formatYearImprovement()` - YoY improvement display

### 5. Component Improvements
- **Before**: 140+ lines of complex inline calculations
- **After**: Clean component with memoized data transformations
- **Benefits**:
  - All calculations moved to testable services
  - Better performance with useMemo hooks
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Reusable year analysis logic

## Data Flow

```
Raw Scores from Supabase
    ↓
yearAnalysisService.aggregateYearlyStatistics()
    ↓
Year Model Instances (one per year)
    ↓
yearAnalysisService.formatYearDataForCharts()
    ↓
Chart-Ready Data Arrays
    ↓
chartDataHelpers (specific formatting)
    ↓
YearByYearAnalysis Component (Pure Presentation)
```

## Key Features Preserved

1. **Year Trend Analysis**
   - Multi-year performance tracking
   - Average score and best score trends

2. **Monthly Performance**
   - Monthly breakdown within selected year
   - Bar chart visualization

3. **Scoring Distribution**
   - Pars, bogeys, doubles+ pie chart
   - Percentage calculations

4. **Course Breakdown**
   - Most played courses per year
   - Sorted by frequency

5. **Par Type Performance**
   - Par 3/4/5 averages
   - Color-coded performance indicators

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Testability**: All year calculations can be unit tested independently
2. **Reusability**: Year analysis available for other components
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between data logic and UI
4. **Performance**: Memoized calculations prevent unnecessary recalculations
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new year metrics or visualizations

## Usage Example

```javascript
import { aggregateYearlyStatistics, getCompleteYearAnalysis } from '../services/yearAnalysisService'

// Aggregate all years
const yearStats = aggregateYearlyStatistics(scores)

// Get detailed analysis for 2024
const analysis2024 = getCompleteYearAnalysis(yearStats, 2024)

// Access formatted data
console.log(analysis2024.monthlyTrend) // Monthly performance
console.log(analysis2024.seasonalAnalysis) // Seasonal breakdown
console.log(analysis2024.topCourses) // Most played courses
```

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for Year model methods
2. Add integration tests for yearAnalysisService
3. Consider adding more temporal analyses (weekday vs weekend, time of day)
4. Add export functionality for year reports
5. Implement year-to-year comparison views
